		<h2> Movies in the future </h2>	 
		<h3> Ant-Man and the wasp<h3>
		<p>
			Ant-Man And The Wasp will not only feature the return of Paul Rudd (Scott Lang), Evangeline Lilly (Hope Van Dyne), Michael Douglas (Hank Pym), Michael Pena (Luis), and Judy Greer (Maggie), but it's also been revealed that new additions include Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet Van Dyne, Randall Park as Jimmy Woo, Laurence Fishburne as Dr. Bill Foster, Walton Goggins as Sonny Burch, and Hannah John-Kamen as Ghost. It's been rumored that the film will not only see the adventures of the modern versions of the titular heroes, but also feature plenty of flashbacks with young Hank Pym and Janet Van Dyne.

		<h3> Captain Marvel<h3>
		<p>
			Though originally meant to drop in late 2018, the anticipated Captain Marvel film is now scheduled to be released as the first Marvel Studios film of 2019. The blockbuster will center on Marvel character Carol Danvers in what's said to be a very earthbound adventure (though her powers are "in the cosmic realm," having come from the alien race known as the Kree). It's also been confirmed that the movie will be an origin story for the titular character, will co-star Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, will be set in the 1990s, and will be the first in the franchise to specifically feature the aliens known as the Skrulls.

		<h3> Untitled Avengers: Infinity War Sequel<h3>
		<p>
			By May 3, 2019, Marvel fans around the world will be foaming at the mouth. A big part of what made Avengers: Infinity War so breathtaking was its incredible ending, which saw fans witnessing the deaths of many of their favorite heroes. It was a hard thing to watch, but in 2019 we'll get to see if Earth's Mightiest Heroes and the Guardians of the Galaxy can get their revenge.
